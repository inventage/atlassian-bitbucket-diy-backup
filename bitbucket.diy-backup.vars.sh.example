#  - postgresql-fslevel - PostgreSQL with data directory located in the file system volume as home directory (so
#                         that it will be included implicitly in the home volume snapshot)

#                         all Elasticsearch state is stored under ${BITBUCKET_HOME}/shared and therefore already
#                         included in the home directory snapshot implicitly.
#
#                         NOTE: If Bitbucket is configured to use a remote Elasticsearch instance (which all Bitbucket
#                         Data Center instances must be), then its state is NOT included implicitly in home directory
#                         backups, and may therefore take some to rebuild after a restore UNLESS one of the following
#                         strategies is used.
#
#  - fs                 - Shared filesystem - requires all data and master nodes to mount a shared file system to the
#                         same mount point and that it is configured in the elasticsearch.yml file. See
#                         https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html
#
#  - s3                 - Amazon S3 bucket - requires the Elasticsearch Cloud plugin to be installed. See
#                         https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/2.3/cloud-aws.html
#
#  - amazon-es          - Amazon Elasticsearch Service - uses an S3 bucket as a snapshot repository. Requires both
#                         python and the python boto package to be installed, in order to sign the requests to AWS ES.
